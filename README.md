# Replicating The International Trade and Production Database for Estimation (ITPD-E)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to help me understand what was done and
how was done in the article.

There are still many things I don’t understand, starting by converting
HS to ISIC codes, to start with.

In the meanwhile I scraped some tables from the PDF.

# Agriculture

## Final goal

## Time range

1986-2020

## Sources

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Statistics
Division (FAOSTAT), which gathers data from UNSD, Eurostat, and other
national authorities as needed.

## Special cases

From the article:

> FAOSTAT does not include international trade data for FCL item 27
> “rice (paddy)”. Instead, we use data from the UN Commodity Trade
> Statistics Database (COMTRADE), HS sector 100,610 “Cereals; rice in
> the husk (paddy or rough)”
